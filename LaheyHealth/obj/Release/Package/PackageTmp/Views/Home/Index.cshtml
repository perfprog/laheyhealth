        <h2>Welcome to the Leading Forward Competency Assessment!</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Leading Forward Competency Assessment has been created to help you understand your leadership strengths (skill level) in relationship to your specific role (Importance). Built using twenty-six leadership competencies divided into three categories of leadership: Leading Oneself, Leading Others and Leading Organizations, each competency includes a few statements that describe the behaviors needed to perform that leadership or coaching skill. When completing the assessment, think through your answers by remembering how you might have interacted with a team member, peer or boss.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            After you have finished the leadership assessment, complete your development plan (located on Lahey Learning MassNet) to help you prioritize your learning objectives, identify and track measurable results and better select from Lahey Leadership Academy courses and other development offerings.
